3. In Hub There will be methods Called from Clinet->Server and by variable Clients are called methods from Server to client
4. Add  app.MapSignalR(); to Startup.cz in Configuration(IAppBuilder app) mathod
5. Add View for fontroler i.e. Test.cshtml
6. In View Add @section scripts {} (will be rendered in _Layout.cshtml, when @RenderSection("scripts", required: false))
7. implement 

$(function ()
{ 
    var hub = $.connection.testHub; //!!first letter is small (same name as hub in /Hubs folder) 
    chat.client.NameOfMethodWhitchCouldBeCalledFromServerToClient(){} 
    
    //This is called aftert connestion is initialized
    $.connection.hub.start().done(function () 
    {
        //Here we can call methods from Hub -> thus calls coul be set as even handlers i.e. onclick event
        hub.server.methodImplementedInTestHubClass();
    }
}
